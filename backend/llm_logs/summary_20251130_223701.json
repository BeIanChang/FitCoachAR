    "llm_response": "Great job pushing through your bicep curls session, you completed a total of 4 reps with a focus on building strength. Although your form accuracy was at 25%, which is an area to work on, it's a starting point to improve from. One key area to focus on for next time is reducing the 3 errors detected, which likely stemmed from rushing through the movement, so try to prioritize a slower and more controlled tempo to ensure proper form. Keep up the good work and don't get discouraged - with practice and dedication, you'll see improvement and be curling like a pro in no time!"
